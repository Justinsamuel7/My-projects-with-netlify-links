      <h2>User Authentication</h2>
      <p>A basic React app was created using <b>HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and React</b> for learning purposes. The app initially presents a
        login form to the user. When the user enters a username and password that matches the stored user details, the home
        page is rendered. The app utilizes local storage to maintain the logged-in state even after page refreshes.</p>

      <h2>Social Media Comments</h2>
      <p>The Social Media Comment Retrieval Application is a basic web project built using <b>JavaScript and the DOM</b>. It allows users to view comments for a specific post by <b>making API calls</b> to retrieve the comments data. The application displays the post titles and authors, and when users click on "Comments," it fetches and dynamically displays the corresponding comments below the post. The project showcases how to handle API requests and update the DOM to create a simple social media-like experience for users.</p>
